# Unity Installation/Uninstallation

## Install Script
The purpose of the install-unityhub.sh script is to properly install the official Unity Hub program from Unity Technologies with proper Ubuntu/Ubuntu Based key management. 

Since the offical installation forum from Unity tells the user to use apt-key, which is depricated, this installation script will install it and its keys properly and result in no apt warnings when running the sudo apt update command.

# Uninstall Script
The purpose of the uninstall-unityhub.sh script is to properly uninstall the offical Unity Hub program from Unity Technologies from a Ubuntu/Ubuntu-based Linux disto if the provided install-unityhub.sh script was used to install it.

This uninstall script will ensure that the program and its keys are properly removed from the system.
